          Chef Yossi Shitrit has been living and breathing his culinary dreams
          for more than two decades, including running the kitchen in his first
          restaurant, the fondly-remembered Violet, located in Moshav Udim.
          Shitrit's creativity and culinary acumen born of long experience are
          expressed in the every detail of each and every dish.
